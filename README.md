# Chatbot — Internet Technologies micro-site

This small micro-site contains our group's presentation and a short tutorial about chatbots for the Internet Technologies course.

Files
- `index.html` — landing/welcome page (this is the site root).
- `styles.css` — site styling (already added).
- `presentation/` — (create this folder) place `group-presentation.pdf` or an interactive `index.html` for the slides.

How to view

- Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click the file).
- Option 2 (recommended for some features like fetch or local includes): run a simple HTTP server from the project root.

If you have Python 3 installed, run:

```pwsh
# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Replace placeholders

- Edit `index.html` to add group member names, course/semester details, and replace the placeholder links in `presentation/` with your actual files.

Need help or want an interactive demo added? Open an issue or ask and I'll help wire up a small JS demo or host the slides.
